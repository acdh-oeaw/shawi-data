                <ANNOTATION_VALUE>Some talked about a sheikh to whom they had brought a girl from another town. The girl has become mad, she was a home-girl.  Her age was seventeen or eighteen and she was mad, she did not know what she was doing. They brought her to doctors, they brought her to professors but they did not find a cure for her. She did not have clear symptoms and so they said, “She’s crazy, we cannot do anything for her.”</ANNOTATION_VALUE>

                <ANNOTATION_VALUE>Then they heard of a sheikh here and brought the girl to the sheikh. When they brought her to the sheikh, he had a look at her and he knew right away (what was wrong with her). He was Sheikh Hādi.  It is said that as soon as he had brought her he grasped the sword for her.  Then he hit her with the sword. – He hit her with the sword?” – Yes, he hit her with the sword. She fell down to the ground.</ANNOTATION_VALUE>

                <ANNOTATION_VALUE>Her mother and her father started to cry and went outside the village shouting, “Our daughter has died! The sheikh has killed her, the sheikh has killed her!” The sheikh, however, took off his cloak and covered her with it, (he spread it) over the woman. Then he took the tambourine and started to perform. They performed lauds (for the prophet Muhammad); he played and sang lauds over her.</ANNOTATION_VALUE>

                <ANNOTATION_VALUE>It is said that after an hour he took away his cloak from her. It is said that the girl was in sweat but well. It is said that she sat up. She sat aside.

The girl had recovered and went away – she was well and went away – immediately. The demons do it like that but the sage men write amulets against them which are made from verses of the Coran. So they cannot come close to you.</ANNOTATION_VALUE>
